Welcome to the official [Astro](https://astro.build/) blog starter template. This template serves as a lightweight, minimally-styled starting point for anyone looking to build a personal website, blog, or portfolio with Astro.

This template comes with a few integrations already configured in your `astro.config.mjs` file. You can customize your setup with [Astro Integrations](https://astro.build/integrations) to add tools like Tailwind, React, or Vue to your project.

Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template:

*   Edit this page in `src/pages/index.astro`
*   Edit the site header items in `src/components/Header.astro`
*   Add your name to the footer in `src/components/Footer.astro`
*   Check out the included blog posts in `src/pages/blog/`
*   Customize the blog post page layout in `src/layouts/BlogPost.astro`
*   OK

Have fun! If you get stuck, remember to [read the docs](https://docs.astro.build/) or [join us on Discord](https://astro.build/chat) to ask questions.
